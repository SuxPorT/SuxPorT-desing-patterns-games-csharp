## Challenge Game: Super Mario World

Let's take as an example a level game such as Super Mario World. What's 
interesting about this style of play is that there's a phase map that gives us 
options to choose some phases (follow phases to the right or to the left, for 
example). Therefore, we need to create a collection that will store the phases 
of the game, where each phase will be an independent object (since each phase of
the game may have its particularities) and, when necessary, go through the 
collection of levels.
