## Challenge Game: Donkey Kong Country

The stages of the Donkey Kong Country game were very engaging and challenging. 
What was also cool about this game is that you could count on the help of other 
animals found inside boxes, according to the game stage, just free them, like an
ostrich, swordfish, frog and a parrot.

Therefore, we will take this scenario as an example, in which we have the 
challenge of creating a class that is flexible enough to be capable of multiple 
behaviors. Now be from a frog, now from an ostrich etc.
