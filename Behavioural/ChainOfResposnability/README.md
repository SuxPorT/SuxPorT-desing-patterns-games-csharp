## Challenge Game: Marvel vs. Capcom

An epic fighting game is Marvel vs. Capcom available for different platforms and
versions that bring together the heroes of video games and comics from both 
universes. A feature very cool is the possibility of choosing more than one 
character and, during the fight, changing characters suffered a determined 
button sequence, with which the fighter replaced already enters the ring 
attacking.

So let's imagine that it has the possibility of choose three characters and 
during the fight we want each character is summoned according to the amount of 
strength and/or power we want at that moment in battle.
