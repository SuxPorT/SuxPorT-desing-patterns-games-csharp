## Challenge Game: Donkey Kong Country

In the classic Super Nintendo game Donkey Kong Country, it was possible to play 
the game stages with two characters, however, only one of them was controlled 
while the other just followed what was defined as the main character. But the 
cool thing is, at any moment of the game, it was possible to change the behavior
of the main character reversing the situation.
