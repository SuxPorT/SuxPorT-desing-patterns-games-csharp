## Challenge Game: Survival game

The scenario of the challenge will be a survival game in jungle. In the game, 
there are different tools and weapons possible to be chosen to play, but it 
needs to define a rule for the character to put in his backpack two tools and a 
weaponry to defend himself from the dangers he will find. For that, we are going
to develop a backpack that will be intelligent, like a robot that will be able 
to say what is available within it quickly when the player requests it.
