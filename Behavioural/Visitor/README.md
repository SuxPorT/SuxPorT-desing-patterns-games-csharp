## Challenge Game: Game with 2 phases and a boss

Imagine that you are facing a game that has its phases well defined, as well as 
the bosses of the game. Then comes the need to develop functionality that 
displays the level or boss difficulty, but you don't want to add that stage by 
stage, or boss by boss. The solution will be to use the pattern Visitor, which 
it will have a method to identify the difficulty both the stages and the bosses 
of  the game. Simply it will call the visitor to contribute by giving this 
information.
