## Challenge Game: Final Fight

In this challenge, the game is a classic released in 1989 by category of games 
called “Beat 'em ups”.

It has a vertically bar representing the amount of “life” of the chosen 
character, which in the case is Cody. With every hit Cody takes from others
opponents, the bar fills up in red and the character loses when the entire bar 
is red.

There are three opponents against the character Cody, so the challenge is to 
create an algorithm that warns the three opponents whenever Cody is hit with a 
punch, that is, when the life point in the game decreases. Let's develop an 
"observer" that will communicate the three opponents whenever Cody is hit.
