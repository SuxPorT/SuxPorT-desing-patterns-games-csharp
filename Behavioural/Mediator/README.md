## Challenge Game: Exchange of messages between players

One of the functions that modern games provide is the possibility of playing 
online and the exchange of messages between players during the game, something 
that was not possible a while ago on the first consoles.

The challenge will be to develop a solution that allow the exchange of messages 
between players. Therefore, we will use the Design Pattern Mediator to receive 
and send the messages to players correctly, such as a postman who receives a 
letter from a sender and delivers it to the respective recipient.
