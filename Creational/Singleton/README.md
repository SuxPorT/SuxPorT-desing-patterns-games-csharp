# Singleton
## Challenge Game: Football

A challenge to control access to instances of the class, ensuring that an object
is instantiated only once, to reduce memory usage and to provide more 
flexibility than with static structures for instantiating objects.

For example, think about a football game. as the rules is that only one ball is
allowed in the field. Therefore, the challenge will be to ensure that only one 
ball is in play on the field.
