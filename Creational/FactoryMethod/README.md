## Challenge Game: Mortal Kombat (1992)

The challenge scenario will be the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat from 
1992. This game has several characters available to choose from.

In this classic, there are a lot of characters available in the game, but only 
one character can be chosen to play. The challenge is to delegate the 
responsibility for subclasses to specify their type. That is, the application 
must be able to identify which character was chosen to play and then instantiate
the object equivalent to the chosen character dynamically.
