## Challenge Game: Medal of Honor

The glorious game Medal of Honor is a classic game in first-person mode, also 
known by the acronym FPS (First Person Shooter, or in Portuguese, shooting in 
first person), which takes place during the Second World War.

Like any other war game, there are different types of soldiers who make up a 
battle army, such as soldiers of special forces attacking from the ground and 
pilots of battle planes who get air flights. Therefore, the challenge is to 
create a builder to assemble an entire army for the battle.
