## Challenge Game: Super Mario World

The classic Super Mario World is made up of several levels and different maps. 
Each stage follows the theme of the map, like stages faunas, forest, cave etc.
With each stage that the player completes, new stages are released on the map so
it can continue trailblazing the game until we can clear it.

The structure of game stages is a descendant in a tree, where there are phases 
that depend on others (nodes), and each set of phases is part of a branch of 
nodes.
