# Adapter
## Challenge Game: Metal Slug X

One of the Arcade classics is the 1999 Metal Slug X game. In this game, Morden 
decides to ally with the aliens who come from space with goal of conquering the 
world. During missions, the objective is to free prisoners who offer weapons and
equipment that can be used in combat to destroy the aliens. Furthermore, 
throughout the phases, the character can also obtain combat vehicles, such as 
using a battle tank or an airplane in battles.

The character can either walk through the stages or use a combat vehicle, which 
can completely change the game commands. In this way, the challenge is to 
develop an “adapter” that makes it possible for them to commands work both if 
the character is in a vehicle or not.

For example, the command "walk" has to work both if the character being piloting
the battle plane, whose action will be “fly”, as if it was just walking, so the 
action will be “go foward".
